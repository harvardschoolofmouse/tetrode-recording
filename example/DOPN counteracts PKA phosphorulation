Why D1 excites SNr:
	To turn off local inhibition: DOPN? counteracts PKA phosphorulation
	Turn of GPe with DREADDS, or just record GPE during D1-stim
	Use sine waves rather than square wave stim
	JOHN: Two tapered fibers in Str, vary depth. For same neurons, are D1-effects opposite for different parts of Str.
